In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many 
problems. One of these problems was the buildings frame. The frame needed to be modified and 
strengthened to accommodate the new mast. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the 
author states, "hydrogen is highly flammable." If a dirigible were to go up in @CAPS1 not only the 
passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high 
altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause 
the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. These 
were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on 
the Empire State Building.
