Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in days. I'm going to tell you 
about a time that I was patient and it paid of. It was @DATE1, exactly two mounts before my 
birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was to young, and that 
she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but 
me, this was partly true. She told me she would about it, and that if I bugged her about it again 
she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @DATE3 now, just @NUM1 more days till my birthday. I thought 
about what kind of phone I wanted, I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought 
about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the 
morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also 
thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday supprise. I opened my 
pressants from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opend it, it was my phone. 
I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is 
a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted. Thats why you should 
always be patient, and wait. By; @PERSON1
